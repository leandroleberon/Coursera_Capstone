# Business Problem
After searching google for Indian Restaurants in Toronto, I found out that there are just a few of them. Given that are just a few Indian Restaurants
in Toronto, it is a great idea to open one, but the great question is where to open it? In this project I will try to analyze Toronto's neighborhoods
and find out which ones would be a great choice to open an Indian Restaurant.
